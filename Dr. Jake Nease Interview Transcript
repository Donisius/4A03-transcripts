[Q1] You probably start Michael, it'll pop up in a second. OK, yeah, so I guess. First thing is if you could just talk a
little bit about Mac like has pushed a lot of experiential education initiatives and we just want to know who's pushing for this
movement. If it's from the academic or industry side and you know what barriers there are to like implementing these initiatives? 
[Q1A]Yeah, that's fair. So so for sure this is something that should be pretty clear. I mean, John TS1P13, which is supposed to be an
experiential learning class. I think the from my perspective and I don't really know what the stakeholders have saved the first year
or the Faculty of engineering level are saying from industry. But I know that a lot, not all, but a lot of the push for experiential
education is come out of the academic side. It's through seeing other schools that have done that sort of thing. And so, like other
MIT engineering program, for example, that does a lot of experiential hands on client based like projects and all of this was was
actually the driving force behind one P. 10 in the Bio Med program, right? And and the whole 1P-10 environment thing was was pretty
successful and so they decided to to stretch it out to the rest of first year engineering. The apprehension there was that people
might not be as interested in that as a first year experience. Coming out of high school, but they might be intimidated by the project
based environment about being in groups all the time instead of the typical course structure. And so there was a little apprehension
there. I think we've shown that that. Isn't really a problem, at least not a not not in this cohort. I suppose you know, going through
this year, the barriers to implementation are are pretty easy to pick off, right? So the first year level, it's easy enough content
wise, even though also Saltley slip in that there's no Kevin Chin. Anything that happens in first year, so but otherwise it's very
easy content wise to integrate these things. The issue with first year is resource is space. You know management of TAS and money
and you know labs and design spaces and that sort of thing. I think in terms of the actual learning outcomes it it came together
very nicely because the team was working on it for a solid like 2 years so. So I think the content is fine. But the main challenge
for rolling this out is definitely resource is now that's not to be confused with experiential education in higher. Here's a in your
second, third or fourth year. Because they are also rolling out. I don't know if you're aware of this new 2P X three and three P X3
which are supposed to be the continuation of 1P13 in higher levels themed toward engineering, economics and whatever. Actually, the
two the second year is communications and the third year is economics. The main difficulty there for implementation is finding common
ground for integrated design projects of higher levels while still achieving the learning outcomes of all the departments. Are all of
the disciplines, but they all have to work together. That's actually extremely hard because you know you could put a Kenny within ECE
and like there is absolutely no way that one could do a circuits based design project. Or the other could do a pump network design,
but there's just no way, right? So you need to find a way because the further away you get from first year, the more specialized your
knowledge becomes, and that's the challenge that they face right now in two P, X3, which is coming out this year now. Luckily for
them two PX is like a communications issue class, so everything is kind of structured around that, so I don't think it's going to be
as technically in depth. But the department interest is very much. We want technical skills as well as the communication skills out
of these integrated learning design courses. So I see that as being the biggest challenge in that going forward. Yeah, that's great,
thanks. 
 [Q2] From your perspective, what role has engineering academia played influencing and influencing industry? And if you see
that changing in the future. Or is industry? Yeah so you mean like from a research perspective or from an undergraduate educations
perspective? Yeah I guess for my undergraduate, yeah. How has engineering academia influenced? Some industry it really. 
 [Q2A]
Really hasn't actually. I think that that maybe something as we go forward is that it's starting to, or at least the feedback loop
of what industry wants, which is more of this. Like, you know, kind of a broader knowledge with a little bit more design experience
and critical thinking, which is something that students desperately lack. Obviously, no offense to the present party, but like you
know, generally speaking, when people come out of an undergraduate program there, like our program, is criticized as having people
that have like learned all these courses but don't have. Open minds and don't know how to take instruction and or aren't able to,
you know, research things independently and learn on the job. Now that's something that is improving with these design courses. In
particular, I think, or those integrated learning courses. And I I really do see, I really do see us just putting out more qualified
individuals. Kind of ready to take on the current engineering role as we go forward as opposed to a little bit more focused on the
technical science, but less so in the overall thrust of what engineering is right, which is to serve and protect the public. And their
interests, and obviously be able to be a functional member of society in that regard. Unfortunately, I don't think I could like the
undergraduate academia has influenced industry, it's industry that's influencing the undergraduate curriculum. No question about that,
but I think there's maybe something about that a little bit later on anyway, so I'll say that answers for that. OK yeah, cool yeah,
I'll get the next one. 
 [Q3] So we've been asking this question to the other people we've been interviewing as well, so we just want
to get an idea from your kind of your colleague space in chemical engineering. To what extent does your faculty of chemical engineering
sort of carry out industry related projects versus more? I guess, quote unquote, pure research projects? 
 [Q3A] Sure, yeah. Yeah,
so so there again, there's two ways to answer that. There's the undergrad side, then is the grad sign, which the grand side with
industry approach is probably more applicable in terms of undergrad, and we typically offer industry related projects through our
new Capstone stream, which is, which is a consulting capstone, and all students have to take that now. That's been a recent change,
again, trying to align a little bit more with what students want and what industry wants on that. When it comes to research projects
in particular, I would say that the Chemistry department actually doesn't. Pretty good job of aligning its interests with industry, so
we have a lot of faculty members in like wastewater treatment. David Latulippe for example, or Charles Dillon Way who work explicitly
with a bunch of wastewater startups and that sort of thing. In order to do that. Obviously on the more meter applied medicine side,
we have a little bit more theoretical stuff, but we got a lot of projects. For example, recently in those fields working with mass
producers and fabricators and those types of people, now I would say that the most. Industry related projects that we have is through
the M ACC. The McMaster Advanced Control Consortium, which is the largest controls an industry networking consortium and research
consortium in Canada. It's got like you know, 25 member companies. Honeywell practice their arsenal Dofasco Xerox like just choose
some big names and Corning and they they work explicitly. A lot of those faculty members. NASCAR Swartzen Konma holiday work. On
industry projects with those companies, so so those are all you know, process intensification. Those are a little process control
based and that sort of thing. So I would say probably 5050 industry projects to to research projects in the important. That's cool,
yeah, I know. In my department computing and software are control courses that we've had our our professor. Doctor Morrisville
has often said that the chemical engineers are the OG's of the of the control engineering space, and they're really what they're
doing. Deeply happy to hear that. It's also we're also the oh geez of optimization, but nobody ever really thinks about us that
way. Or supply chains. Sort of management, and that sort of thing. But anyway, I'm glad it makes me happy to hear that. 
 [Q4] Yeah,
OK, so kind of a fun one here. Can you think of a time in which you were surprised by how some piece of engineering was conducted
in industry? Maybe that would be something that industry does effectively? That wouldn't really be considered best practice,
but from an academic perspective or just a surprise in general.
 [Q4A] Yeah, I absolutely so let me tell you. In Kenji at least,
there is a an overarching theme of if it ain't broke, don't fix it so old equipment's you know things that aren't efficient control
strategies that are just blatantly inefficient but you know, do I want to shut down the plant that's making me $150,000 a day in
order to like, you know, try this new control scheme that an academic is thought up because. Mathematically, right? So the thing
about the the academic rank is this, although theoretically this is better, right? But practically is it better an I find that
something that industry really resists is trying new stuff in that regard, and also a lot of heuristics based design like a lot of
heuristics based design. Where is it a chemical engineering student like Michael might be in heat transfer class and he's like OK,
design this heat exchanger to achieve this thing and he'll go through and do some material selection. Do some shell passes in some
area calculations and whatever. Probably integrate some nonlinear heat capacity 'cause he's a good student like Michael. Thank you
and then we would have and then we would arrive at a design and then in industry they'll just say like. You know we used this heat
exchanger for something that was very close to that, and it was bigger than it needed to be, so we'll just use the same one. Just
give me another one of those right? And like. So I would say something that industry definitely does. That works really well for them
is experience based design or like you know I did this before so I know what I'm doing instead of using modern tools. In that sort
of thing, a lot of back of the envelope calculations and then a lot of real time adjustments in calibrations, which can be pretty
wasteful. But experience is the. Pinnacle of what you need in order to make that work right? So that's probably the most in terms
of the process design and chem in specific. That would be my my answer there for sure, and I think that's also by the way something
that students need to. That's why it's so good that we have co-ops and stuff. That's what students need to be exposed to, at least
in our curriculum before they go out in industry so that when they go out into industry and they're just like you know. Just size
this thing and they get up some old textbook and start working on it and the managers like no no. Look up an old invoice and like
tell me how much it was or something that they're not blown away by this. Gotcha, yeah it makes sense. 
 [Q5] I just wanted to ask
just through your experiences with either conducting research or just being involved in like an engineering project with an industry
like what have you found is the most crucial step to get right within, like that research or engineering process that you've been
through. Like just for example, like in my courses within like software engineering like we haven't drilled into our heads that
you get the right requirements for a project and it's dairy up. Theoretically the most expensive part if you get it wrong. So yeah,
I was just wondering what the most important step has typically been for. 
 [Q5A] Yeah so. Oh yeah, I got a little feedback that was
there. So in my in my experience, I think I would agree with that. Dhoni is the same idea. I think one of the hardest, time consuming
and most important thing to do correctly is to get a project specification hammered out or memorandum of understanding hammered out
or the exact outcomes in whatever contract form that. That's going to be. It takes a lot of time on the on behalf of the engineering
team, working with whatever the client is in order to be able to come up with that sort of thing, especially if it's a. Resulting
project I would say like. 1000%, right? Because it's not like that specifically, is super like expensive. It is right. Time is
money. It is expensive, but what it really is right is that it's the base layer to a pyramid that you're building on top. Where
if the basement is faulty then you can't get anywhere and like the last thing you want to do is not clearly communicate and have
those correct specifications. Design something and then try to make it work and then it doesn't work because the specifications were
wrong, right? So it just snowballs. It just snowballs from there, so in terms of definitely the most important, it's it's hammering
out exactly what the requirements are, and then the back and forth with the client to make sure that you get it right. So I would
for the most part just agree with what you said. 
 [Q6] Awesome, I'm on my second question is like we're always taught within our
courses to be very precise with like documentation and testing. I just wanted to ask if, like professionals don't go into as much
detail or go into more detail in industry like I'd love to get your input on that. 
 [Q6A] With regards to our department, there are
certain things that our department does you know specifically, so you know the heat exact the heat exchanger design calculation. For
example, like that would be something that our students would do a lot more specifically. Perhaps then then industry. But what industry
definitely does better than the students is, you know, bills of materials, technical drawings, you know, like actual, like you know
when I say bill of materials, I don't just mean like stuff like. Units, but I mean like pipelines and valves and fittings. And like
all that sort of stuff because all of that is necessary. And another thing that they'll do is like they'll have very detailed in
house built spreadsheets. For example, to do things like calculate pressure drops and make sure that pressure management is handled
correctly in order to drive the fluid through the process. Whereas our students we don't really do that right like we got like some
throwaway values of oh, you know, like just assume one atmosphere pressure drop through this unit and .1 atmosphere through this
unit. And that's not sufficient for for proper engineering design, so something that the industry people will do a lot better as
they will have a like. First of all that have a paper trail of who designed which piece. Now that always doesn't workout, I've got a
bunch of friends that work at Hatch, for example. They're always banging their heads against the wall because like you know, they're
waiting on something from someone else. So the distribution of Labor issue isn't really resolved in industry, but the accountability
of who's responsible for what, especially if you need to put a stamp on it or something like that is considerably higher than the
level of. Detail for a final design is lightyears beyond what we ever get to in in this curriculum for sure. Alright, awesome, thank
you. Alright, hop in here. 
 [Q7] So what qualities do you think are beneficial to studying or developing engineering theory? Do you
think maybe those qualities are kind of different from actually applying them in practice? 
 [Q7A] They are absolutely different in
application that in practice, but that doesn't mean that the fundamentals aren't hugely important. OK, so like water? Beneficial
I? I'll speak from from my background again, right? So so from Kevin. So some things that are super important is even just things
like mass and energy balances. People take for granted how important it is to be able to do that, especially in an non steady state
environment. And to be able to handle those dynamics so. Theoretically, super, super useful theoretically and let's just say let's
use the PID controller as an example. Is it important for me theoretically to like go through a root locus procedure to, you know,
hammer and nail in where those those polls are supposed to be in this closed loop transfer function? No, it's not. Is it important
that I understand what I need to do to make sure the system is stable and how I can tell if it's going to be unstable and what good
performances versus bad performance if I had to tune online, absolutely it is right, so it's not that the theory is not important,
but when you apply it, it's your connection between the theory and the outcome that is the most important part because oftentimes
they're not going to sit down with MATLAB, Simulink and mess around with a block flow diagram and industries just kind of the way
it is. But the appreciation for what that is. Doing is is key right? Which is kind of why in our curriculum we move towards the
nitty gritty engineering science to take course like thermal dynamics. You know, if they want to mix sucks because it's the attempt
of engineers to reproduce the unreproducible, AKA explain the laws of nature. Not very easy and you like oh, this kind of sucks,
but then you get to your process design where you use a simulator that does those thermodynamics for you, but you appreciate the
fact that this is a necessary outcome and you also understand what is good. Model approximations in water that model approximations,
which is which is very very valuable right? So I would say that the the industry application of theory is very broad, right? It's the
you go around your education learning a bunch of trees and then you go to industry and they ask you to build your forest and they
don't really care what the trees look like right? But the point is, is that you kind of in the back of your head, know what each
little piece of this sort of thing does, and that makes for a good practicing engineer is an appreciation. Do you need to memorize
navier Stokes equation in three dimensions for? Spherical fluid particles, no, but do you need to understand how you know pressure
drops across corners and pipes is going to impact the ability for you to have this tank and then literally 2/3 of a mile away is
where it needs to get to, and it actually isn't nothing. The pressure drop in that line. Yes, that is the important thing, right
so? Awesome, thank you very much. I think that's all the questions I have. Does anyone else have any other pop up questions? I have
a curiosity one. It's not on the list, I'm just kind of thinking of now. 
 [Q8] So yeah, I'm quite ignorant. I mean I have Michaels
here. Michael was my roommate for two years, but otherwise I'm totally ignorant about chemical engineering other than my professor
complementing them as I mentioned. What are so? I guess for my side of things like in the computing department, they're always
talking about how I mean, this is obviously happening. How computing is basically making its way into every sort of ever any legacy
industry that didn't have some form of digital computation going on. It's it's, you know, all the boundaries are being pushed in that
direction. What what effect? What's like? The biggest effect that has had on on kind of chemical engineering and process control and
design and stuff? What do you think is the biggest way that's being pushed right now? 
 [Q8A] Yeah, I'd say that definitely that's a
great. That's a great comment, something that we've been trying to communicate in their undergrad curriculum for a couple of years
now. Is it like images now? Also, you know, simulations and control design, and like you know, using computers to solve problems
because modern problems require modern solutions. I say it over and over again, and. And you know. Using an old school vapor liquid
equilibrium chart on a printed on a piece of paper and ruler it just, you know, just doesn't have its place anymore, so we need to
update the curriculum. As somebody involved with the M ACC, I see countless applications of things like real time optimization. So
maybe you have Poly generation plants that know how to make you know they can take an input of something like maybe bio mass or
coal or natural gas depending on where you are and you can make liquid fuels with zero CO2 missions. You can make power, you can
make heat, you know you can make you can. You could do thermal chemical storage and all of this is encapsulated in an architecture
that's kind of like. A global optimization strategy where you've got kind of the the year long plan informing the month long plane,
informing the weeklong plan, informing the hour to our plan, and then you get the PID controllers that do things. Second, a second
right? And all of this is layered together in a massive architecture that is trying to identify things like market trends and those
parameters are updated in real time. Real time optimization and then they are passed out as requested. I have requested products or
requested operational dynamics. All the time, right? And and and plans updated and plans change what has been accompanied with. That
is a new kind of push towards flexible design. So not just flexible design of the control systems, but you need to be able to handle
those. And to be able to handle those changes with the actual units with the actual plant in that sort of thing. So like I can't just
like turn on or off this industrial piece of equipment that literally takes 3 days to start, right? I can just turn it on and off
every three hours or something like that. So I need to work that into it. And that brings a lot of exceptions. A lot of interesting
problems into that sort of thing. Another good example of how that's working out is with distributed power and energy. So we got
wind turbines. We've got solar panels. We've got nuclear plants. We've got gas plants we've got. You know bio mass incinerators
and they're all over the place with what they're producing, so the question becomes, how do you design the control structure or
architecture to be able to utilize that at the community scale at the provincial scale at the national scale so that you don't waste
all of this garbage right? Well, now it's not garbage, it's valuable energy, right? But, but these are definitely directions and then
kind of your lowest hanging fruit that we even touch on at the undergraduate level is like integrated. We called Gray box modeling. So
like a PID controller is a very black box style of controller it has. No concept of what's going on in the process at all. It's just
like where I'm at where I want to be. Go to the thing being, whereas we're working a little more with data driven modeling and first
principles, modeling to do things like model predictive control which is actually working its way into industry where you actually
use those first principle models. Unfamiliar with MPC at all, but the idea is that you have a mathematical model that predicts the
behavior of a system for a given set of inputs, and then you actually apply those inputs. Knowing what the future outcome is going to
be and you kind of update that in real time as well, and so all of these kind of cutting edge. I mean MPC isn't even cutting edge,
but it's cutting edge for industry. If there's a good example like MPC is like a 30 year old idea and it's now just making his way to
like the mainstay in industry, and that's typically about writing kanjis, we usually get about 30 year lag between what they're coming
up within academia and where it's going in industry. And you know, as we go towards. Three 4.0 with easy data acquisition, right like
tons of data everywhere. Integrated units that can communicate with each other in, like the implementation of all of these things
is going to be something that were we're looking to get into in the near future, no doubt. That's cool, yeah. 
 The Mechatronics
curriculum just added record is called intelligent and Predictive Control I think. And one of the one of the things, well, yeah,
I took that course in the fall term and it's shocking how much I I'm already forgetting about that. But one of the things we talked
about was model predictive control and state space modeling and Kalman filtering. All that kind of thing and. It was, yeah it was
interesting but. Yeah, that's the stuff that you guys do in undergrad chemical inch chemical and stuff is that it's still more of like
a grad student thing or. Yeah, good good question. So we do MPC and stuff at the undergrad level at least introduction to linear MPC
and state space. I don't know Michael is taking four deals 3 but so like that's a linear state space in model predictive control and
digital controls. Course. Sequel to our standard controls course or alcohol at the analog controls course. And that's typically pretty
popular. It's it's kind of a couple of rough offerings with some sessional, so you know, but but it's a good. It's a good course,
and then when it comes to things like nonlinear MPC Kalman filters, observers I don't know if you talk about luenberger, observers, or
anything that picture that's a little bit more still in Canada Gran topic, but as we just learned this year, I mean Michael took four
H 03, which is just chock full of topics then. I took when I was in grad school because it was never offered at the undergrad level
and everybody proved to me that they can do it at the undergrad level, right? You can't get into it in quite as much detail so that
things like latent variable methods and neural networks and all that sort of stuff like you can get an introduction at the undergrad
level. So as the topic start to become more applicable in industry, you find those more high end topics getting filtered into the
undergrad curriculum because that's now what our students need going into industry, right? So I'm glad you got to take a course like
that. I hope it was good. Yeah, OK, that's that's very interesting that those questions weren't really related to our project, but I
was just kind of curious. So thank you. 
 
 Wrap up: Inside anything else I can do for you fellows, or are we going to? Michael. Sorry
Bros yeah, I think that's about it for. Everybody, yeah. Does anybody else have any questions? I will offer my thanks to Jake. Nice
for his time on Friday on a Friday afternoon. To squeeze this in, so we appreciate it, I think we got some really good really good
kind of talks, points to talk about in our report. So thanks to Jake and maybe maybe some of us will collide with you at some point
in our last year, but maybe not, but either way. Yeah, so thank you and you know when you're in your final year and in four a. Of
course an should you need any follow up information or want to chat again about things related to four. If you missed anything more
than happy to meet up, I don't know when this is. Do it over the weekend or early next week if you need to ask any follow up so I can
also answer for email. OK OK great. It's due tomorrow night. No no no. Sorry, just let me know if you need anything else from us and
otherwise have a great weekend. Thanks. Take care. Got it. 
 Sweet. OK folks, that that all went pretty good washing in Jake I think
yeah. Yeah, well done I guess, but I don't want to do anymore work today. No, no, I'm I'm. I'm done so I got some plans so. OK cool,
so how do you guys want to go? No. Do you guys like wanted like should our next meeting be on Tuesday or something earlier? Yeah,
what sort of go ahead, John, I don't really have any ideas. I was going to say maybe we meet over the weekend at least. Just skim
over everything and just draw similarities and contrasts between the different perspectives and kind of once we figure out what
we've got, we can look at. Collecting resource is that, or citations that support or counter those arguments, and we can just kind
of expand from there once we review everything. Yeah, or at least like plan out kind of. Who wants to look into what for the lit
review. Basically, like I like. I like this idea. I would enjoy doing some research on that or something like that. OK, yeah, we
can do that. I don't know what to do Sunday. Yeah, OK, yeah sounds good. They like like mid afternoon maybe. Yeah. Yeah so 2. Yeah,
like with three be good too. Yeah 2:30 or three. Rehab is good with I, you know, you know me, I've gotta give like the something or
something. 2:30 or three, never specific. I like OK. OK cool, thanks a bunch dudes and we will see you will see you then. Oh I later
I guess.
