Second, see it
once again to give you a little overview of what we're doing. So for our summer course for AO3, it's all about ethics and equity
and all that good stuff. But we've been kind of exploring more differences in theory, So what they tell you to do versus what's
actually best practice, like in professional scenarios in the workforce, all that good stuff. So so when you say theory, you're
not talking about like theory as in like numerical theory, you're talking about best practices. Yeah, like how how things actually
get done? Best practice, yeah. OK, awesome so yeah. So our first question or kind of discussion prompt most of these are going to be
basically what we're taught in school or academics versus some sort of connection with industry. And yeah, something like that. 
 
 
[Q1] So for this question, we know that Mac recently been pushing a lot for experiential education, clearly seen through �the pivot�
and what's to come for the next few years. So who do you think is pushing for this movement? Is this more so from the school, or is
the industry sort of asking for this?
 [Q1 Answer] I don't think industry is necessarily asking for it, but they don't ask us for
anything right? Like that. That's not really how that relationship works, and so I think a lot of it is coming from the broader�
I don't think it's actually coming from either. I think that the university is responding to the broader trends in education and
kind of the realization that students are asking for more engaging formats right, that you know if all you need is the content,
you could go read a book. You can take an online course you know, and that's free, right? There's no reason to pay 15 grand a year
or whatever it is that you pay. You know the real value in going to a good school. It is those hands on experiences like labs
and things like that. And so the more of that we can offer, the more we can offer you good value for your tuition. And there's
there's a lot of good educational research. Indicating that that doing hands-on work helps with retention. And and that you know,
generally speaking, not necessarily that we were doing like a bad job before, or anything like that. But you know, when we have
the flexibility to be able to offer lectures online and then do stuff hands on in the classroom, that seems to be you know, aligned
with what we know about neuroscience and learning, whether or not that actually works the way that we're intending to. That's still
an open question. 'cause these are still pretty new approaches, but that's the intention, right? Is that? It's not necessarily that
they're learning anything different and said students are hopefully going to retain more of it. But we still don't know, yeah.
 
 
[Q1 � part 2] Were there any barriers that you notice when we were implementing any of these new initiatives?
 [Q1 � part 2 - Answer]
I think that the biggest barrier is physical space, right and you know from your work in in 1P13 that if you have 1000 people right,
and they all� you know a lot of times when we design courses we intend for everyone to be kind of doing the same thing at the same
time. Well if you have 1000 people, it's really hard to have a thousand 3D printers lined up ready to go, or you know even 1000
computers lined up and ready to go. You know getting that that logistical side of it and getting the physical space is in line with
where they need to be because you know, we have lots and lots of lecture spaces on campus. We don't have as many hands on spaces,
and you know, even just getting the right equipment in the right room at the right time is quite challenging, right? 
 
 [Q2]
So from your perspective, I guess this could be like an �either/or� scenario. Do you think that Engineering academia, so the sort
of content we're giving to the students, is influencing the direction that the industry may be going? Or do you think that seeing
what's happening in the industry is affecting what's being delivered to the students, and that dynamic changing academia?
 [Q2 Answer]
I mean, it's hard to say because like it is kind of an ecosystem, right? Everyone who's practicing engineering now came out of this
system, right? So absolutely everyone who is currently practicing engineering was at one point where you are right. So you can't have
a system that's composed 100% of people who came from that system and not have an effect on it, right? It's bound to happen, but in
terms of the curriculum development and things like that. It's probably more likely that changes in industry and changes in particular
technology availability that is more likely to affect us rather than us affecting industry. I mean, I think it's you know, especially
on the curriculum side if you're talking about on the research side, then yeah, research does tend to flow out of the university,
right? Like that's our product is research, but if you think about it from the instructional side, generally we would be kind of like
consumers of industrial knowledge if that makes sense.
 
 [Q3] So for your faculty specifically, among your colleagues and stuff,
what extent does your faculty carry out industry related projects as compared to more �pure research� projects? 'cause I know a few
professors in my department, computing and software, their projects are industry based and they're getting funding from there, and
his grad students are almost like contractors to help them out. But as opposed to like kind of a �pure research� initiative where
you apply for funding and stuff like that. So within your circle how would you describe that that dynamic?
 [Q3 answer] Yeah, so I
don't do any domain research at all, right? Because I'm a teaching Prof. But you know, I come from mechanical engineering, and so your
observation about what's going on in computing and software is actually probably pretty accurate for mechanical engineering as well,
just because of the work we tend to do, it tends to be very industrially oriented, right it's. All about design. Build test. It is kind
of our cycle right? And so actually like when you look at the funding priorities from insert like the national. Funding organization,
though those are very heavily biased towards industrially relevant research, and so it's like I don't know anyone who's doing
purely scientific research in mechanical engineering because I don't. Know how you would possibly get it funded, right? Like given
the way that answer is funding our domain right now. I mean, I'm sure that there's some things that are like a little bit exotic,
but they will eventually turn into something, so the ambition is that even the exotics that will turn into something industrially
relevant someday, right? Like that guy who won the Nobel Prize pretty recently, like at the time his work was really exotic. But
now we have it all the time in the displays, right? And so. Yeah, like at one time it was like really kind of blue sky, but it still
had an industrial application and so yeah as a mechanical engineer like the idea of completely theoretical research is very like I
don't know. I guess I don't know anyone who does that.
 
 [Q4] I'm not super familiar with sort of the graduate engineering side of
things, so that's interesting here. Yeah, another thing I was wondering - if you can think of a time for yourself, where you were
surprised by how some piece of engineering was conducted in industry, or finding out that some industry does something a certain
way effectively that actually wouldn't really be considered �best practice� by the more academic side of things. Can you think of
any examples of that?
 [Q4 answer] Yeah, I mean when I was in the industry I was in forensic analysis, so as industries go it was
very academically oriented. Like we wrote research papers. In house, a lot of our staff members had PHD's was pretty common so I may
not be the best example because I went from working in a bit like I went from grad school to working in a very academic industry to
back to grad school right? So I never really like left so to speak, but I I did obviously, but I you know I was always working with
people who had that research orientation. Right, but I would say that one of the big differences between how we teach engineering
and how industry operates is that when I was working in industry, I would have like probably 30 files on the go at at a time, like
30 distinct clients distinct projects right at various stages of completion because doing forensic analysis it takes. Sometimes it
takes years for things to work their way through the court system or to work their way through, like attempts at settlement and stuff
like that. And so you wouldn't just. It's not like where in the academic instruction mode we give someone a project at 12 1/2 weeks
later they hand in something that's normally complete that almost never happened to me in industry. So the only time it would happen
would be if a client would call and they say, OK, we're going to court and we're inside of what they call the 60 day deadline. And
there's a real rush on this, because if you don't get me your report to me within the next 60 days, it can't be served as the trial
will be over. Right, like sometimes you would have like one of those real screaming rushes, but in general. There is a lot more
simelton 80 in our work in industry compared to you know. Soon sit down and they're like Oh yeah, I've got six classes. Oh my God,
that would be a very light load for me and industry right? But the contrast is that. And industry I was solving the same types of
problems over and over again and like so that makes it much easier. Whereas in the academic world you could be taking six totally
different classes, right? And they may have nothing to do with each other. That would also be really rare and industry right? Because
the way that you develop your business is that you get specialized at something and you can do it efficiently. More so than someone
else could write like you don't have to go back to first principles 'cause you already have the background data or the background
tools to do it. You know, and I think that's the big difference, right? It is is that a lot of times you know you become much, much
more specialized than you do in an undergraduate engineering degree. You're much more of a generalist, right?
 
 
 [Q5] I was just
wondering just through your experiences with either conducting research or being involved in an engineering project in industry -
what have you found is the most crucial step to get right in the engineering design process? Like for example in my courses in software
engineering I was taught that just identifying the right requirements for project is theoretically the most expensive step to get
wrong 'cause everything builds up on that. I was just wondering what the most important step typically is in projects like in the
field?
 [Q5 answer] That is 100% accurate and I think it's accurate across pretty much every domain. My mom has a saying start the we
mean to go and I feel it's. I say it like probably John probably hear me say it twice this week at work. And I think that it's it's
totally accurate if you start a project off on the wrong foot with a client or with a misunderstanding, but what they want. Then
your project is pretty much doomed and and you know and even doing forensic analysis, where we're actually making a product, we
are product was analysis. We had a checklist at the very beginning of the client interaction to make sure that we were asking the
right questions to make sure that we do that. When we went out into the field, like data that we were collecting the right data,
right? Because you know, you can imagine that you know if you're going out. And you're examining a vehicle before it gets crushed,
right? Once it gets crushed, the data is gone, right? So you have to get the that you have to collect the right data at that point
'cause you only have the one crack at it. And if you don't collect the right data, your analysis will never be correct. And so if
you get the beginning part of it wrong, or vice versa, you go out and you collect way too much data and you charge the client like a
ton of money for a pretty simple issue, they're going to be really mad at you, right? And so if you have a misunderstanding of what
the client wants. Or not exactly what they want, but with the client needs, which can be 2 totally different things. You know if
you get that wrong, you're absolutely just up a Creek. You're really, you know. It's really, really hard to walk that back. 
 
 [Q6]
I just had another question as well. It goes back to us always being taught to be very precise within our courses with documentation
and testing. I just wanted to know if professionals in the field don't go into as much detail, or if they go into more detail when it
comes to documentation and testing, then we're taught in our courses.
 [Q6 answer]  Yes, from my experience we understate how important
documentation is in an academic program and part of the reason we do that is because academic, like we couldn't grade in that level of
detail. It wouldn�t be impossible, right? Like we you know, and it also it wouldn't be a fair burden to put on students to have that
level of documentation 'cause they don't have as many supports in place as we do an industry. But when everyone I know who works as
an engineer is more aggressive with documentation than we are in the academic world and the reason why is that your documentation
oftentimes has a legal implication, right? So if you're working on a big infrastructure project and something happens, you want
to have all of your documentation really tight. Because if you don't and something goes wrong and the company is sued, then your
company could be more liable than they ought to be, right? Like for example, I have a friend who works on kind of big infrastructure
projects and there's a lawsuit, and everyone on the project is involved in the lawsuit and they're going through every email she sent
on the project, right? And you know, and because she's a really thorough and detail oriented person, it's no stress. It's fine, their
documentation was really tight, but if it hadn't been. Then then this small company would have been exposed to a lot of liability
on this humongous lawsuit, and it was the same for me. You know, in my case, you know if I didn't take the right notes or whatever
it is. When I was inspecting a vehicle and the case ultimately went to court. You know, then, how do I explain that right? And you
know, Annefors and the other side can always subpoena my notes and you know, and also to like say that you're working on a project,
say as a Co-op student or something like that, right? And you leave the company? Well, the project is probably carrying on for years
after that, and on these really big projects you know, like mining explorations or you know building a bridge or whatever. You know,
there's probably hundreds of people involved, right? And they all need to understand what's going on. You know, so you might think
like, oh, I don't need to be all that precise with documentation, but everyone I know like you know, documentation is super super
important and it was super important when I was working in industry right BN part of it was because I was working in a legal kind of
field. But everyone I know who again works in those kind of big multinational projects are even more precise about it because again
you don't want to put the company in a in a bad position, right? 
 
 [Q7] Can you talk a little bit about what qualities you think
are beneficial to studying engineering theory and, compared to qualities needed in effectively applying engineering principles in
practice?
 [Q7 answer] I think that it can differ right? Because it's totally possible to get through engineering school with pretty
good grades and horrible people skills. It's you know, I'm sure you know people like that, right? It's much less likely that you're
going to have a successful career in industry with those characteristics, right? You know, I think that students are very worried
about making a technical mistake, and there are way more worried about that than they are. But the interpersonal side. But when I
think about the problems, they kept my seniors up at night when I was. Those problems were almost always interpersonal, because
generally speaking the technical work isn't that hard right? The technical work is pretty logical and and you can always reason
it through. Or you can ask someone, or you can look it up, or you know, like the technical stuff is pretty easy to learn and you
know, again, because most companies are pretty specialized. You have all the resources you need to do that technical work well,
and you're doing the same kinds of technical work pretty commonly, so it's not as much of an intellectual stretch as an undergrad
is where. You're trying to do all kinds of different technical work industry. You know, it feels easier. It's not because the work
itself is easier, it's just that you become better at it and more specialized. But the big problems, the unsolvable problems are the
interpersonal ones. And so if you have someone who has really good technical skills. And they can't get along with anyone. There
they're in a really career limited position, right? They aren't going to get promoted. They aren't going to be able to climb the
ladder. They may not even be able to stay in place very long because it's really rare to work alone on these projects, right? You
know, again, like say that you're working on a big infrastructure project is not going to be just you right? Ultimately, you need
to be able to communicate with others and work with others. And you know, it's something that we're trying to build in more of in
engineering education, but I don't know that it's necessarily always getting through to students right? That that it's very rare
to work as a sole practitioner as an engineer. And if you want to be on the really good projects, you have to be pretty good to
work with, right? And being right isn't nearly enough because everyones right, you know. Basically, right like that's kind of the
bare minimum. It is being correct, but you want to be correct. Pleasant to work with, right? Yeah, because you know those kinds of
miscommunications can end up being really expensive, right? Because say that you make a client really upset, or you miscommunicate
something and you promised something to the client that you can't deliver, or you know. Or you could deliver it, but it's gonna be
really expensive for the company. You know, it might sound like kind of like a soft skill and nice to have, but those things have
super serious consequences when you're communicating with the client. 
 
 [Q8] I think we have one more question so that we can try
and sneak in here. So earlier on you were talking about diversity within your faculty. So do you think there was enough diversity in
your faculty in terms of like knowledge, skills and experience? And if so, do you know what the process that the faculty went through
to get the diversity? (Dr. H: Like in terms of like diverse things that we study or diverse human beings?) I guess a little bit of
everything� mainly towards like what we study, and in the backgrounds and experiences people are bringing to the table.
 [Q8 answer]
But even as well like everything we study, we have almost no control over, so you may not realize is that students but but because
we are operating in Canada, all of our engineering schools are accredited, which means that we all have to follow pretty close to
the same curriculum for a given program actually. Right now John, yeah, you been involved in it right where we have to. Basically,
account for the fact that our students are getting however many units of something or another, right, and so to make sure that all
of the engineering programs across Canada are nominally equivalent, and so you know we have some freedom in terms of the projects
that we assign. But in terms of what we teach, it's actually quite tightly prescribed because we're trying to pack a lot into for
a four year program, right? In terms of people you know, the hiring process is, you know most people stay. At a university for like
30 years, right? And so a lot of times the die is cast 30 years ago in terms of who's involved in something right? And you know it
like. Our hiring processes are very slow moving in academia, right? Because we just have a lot less turnover that we do in almost
any other industry, you know, and so you know the I know that the faculty has been making some big efforts in terms of. In terms of
recruiting, people of like either from minority backgrounds like I know that there's been some big pushes to try and find Aboriginal
scholars. Or you know, people from underrepresented groups, whether it's LGBTQ or or. People who are black or people from abroad, but
you know, on the other hand, it's kind of a pipeline problem, right? Like you know, the process to become someone with a PhD. There's
a lot of privilege inherent in that. But you need to be able to take the time out like first of all you have to get through undergrad
right? Which means spending four years not earning much money and spending a lot of tuition. So that's that's privileged there. And
then there's the privilege of getting a PhD, which means spending four or five years, making pretty much no money, you know. And
so if you're coming from a disadvantaged academic background, for example, that's not really open to you, right? So it's not as
though. When we have these hiring processes that. That you know there's tons of diverse applicants that are coming and they're
being turned away. That's not it at all. It's that they're not even meeting the basic qualifications, 'cause they haven't had the
advantages that that other people have had, and so it's it takes a really long time to catch up because we have a low turnover and
we got to get people in the pipeline. Basically in high school, right? We have to get people in high school, saying, yeah, I'd like
to be an engineer. And then they have to get through undergrad. And I have. So yeah, I'd like to be a professor, you know. And so
you know, I think it's a. It's a really long time scale. I think everyone is doing their their bast, you know to get diverse people
in the room. But it's certainly not a quick fix. It's you know, it's a really substantial undertaking.
